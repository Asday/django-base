# Requirements

* Docker 1.13.0 or higher ([CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/), [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/), [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/), [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/), [Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Docker#Installation));
* `docker-compose`, (Linux only, instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/));
* [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) to use the convenience scripts in [`bin/`](bin/);
* [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation) for development certificates.  Make sure to run `mkcert -install` if you want your browser to trust the certificate, and DO NOT export or share `rootCA-key.pem` under any circumstances;
* [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to benefit from automatic `.envrc` management - it's possible to get by without this, but in that case, `source .envrc` is required in every new shell, and cleaning up the environment upon leaving the project is the responsibility of the reader.

# Installing

```
./bin/install
```

The project will then be put into a running state.

# Running the project

```shell
start
```

For more commands, see [`bin/`](bin/).

# Periodic maintenance

Certificates generated by `mkcert` only last a couple years.  To make new ones, run `cert-update`.

# Shell completion

Shell completion for `manage` subcommands is available but not automatically managed by `direnv`.

To load shell completions, run `source completions-load` in each new shell.  To unload the loaded completions, run `source completions-unload`.

To update the shell completions, for instance when adding/removing installed apps that change the available manage commands, run `completions-regenerate && source completions-load`.
